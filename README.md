## Binary Repository

This repository contains precompiled binary artifacts of popular open-source libraries for the Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, etc.). At the moment, all artifacts are bundled as XCFrameworks, but potentially other formats are possible, such as e.g. artifact bundles. 


## Licences

As license information of each library may vary from version to version, the respective `LICENSE` files can be found for each specific library version under `library_name/version/LICENSE`.
